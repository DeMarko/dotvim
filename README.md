DeMarko vimfiles
================

These are some of the files I use with vim everyday.
I'm normally torn between vim 7.0 and [MacVim][] (7.3 gui)
I recommend looking at [this guide](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/) if you're getting started or trying to clone my files and not having any luck.

### disclaimer ###
I write a good amount of PHP at work so it may lean a bit in that direction

### acknowledgements ###
here are some of the things I couldn't submodule:

+  tomasr's [molokai][] 
+  Lars H. Nielsen's [wombat][]
+  Peter Hodge's [php.vim][]
+  Ken Earl's [smarty.vim][]
+  Rainer M. Schmid's [valgrind.vim][]
